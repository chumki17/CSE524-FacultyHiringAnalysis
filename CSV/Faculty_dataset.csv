He then joined The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) as a Bioinformatics Scientist, where he was responsible for the development of genome assembly algorithms. During this time, Dr. Pop participated in a number of bacterial and eukaryotic genome projects including important human pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis and Entamoeba hystolitica. Since joining the University of Maryland, Dr. Pop has continued to develop novel approaches for genome assembly and analysis, and has developed extensive expertise in the analysis of metagenomic data. His lab has developed a number of widely used open-source software tools, such as the assembly suite AMOS, the NGS aligner Bowtie, the taxonomic classifier Metaphyler, and the metagenomic assembly package MetAMOS. Most recently he co-led the data analysis working group for the Human Microbiome Project and led the sub-group responsible for the assembly of the data generated in this project. In the context of pathogen detection and identification, Dr. Pop was a key member of the team that analyzed the Bacillus anthracis strains used in the biowarfare attack from 2001, helping to develop the diagnostic test that ultimately helped to identify the source of the attack strain.",https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/mpop,,,

He served as director of the UMD Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) from 2010 to 2018 and as the interim Vice President for Research during 2016 - 2017. A leader in interactive visual computing research, Varshney’s work has focused on exploring the applications of high-performance computer graphics and visualization in science, engineering, and medicine. His research results are being used in climate modeling, plasma physics, nanomanufacturing, the design of buildings, cars, and submarines, medical imaging, gene sequencing, and the creative arts. He has engaged in research collaborations with a variety of partners in industry and government agencies.; Varshney has worked on the design and implementation of virtual walkthroughs of proposed structures, such as buildings, automobiles and submarines. His research in molecular graphics has involved devising new algorithms for parallel and analytical computation and visualization of molecular surfaces, their interfaces, and electrostatics.; Varshney has also contributed toward the development of new algorithms for a number of research areas in graphics and visualization including visual saliency, summarization of large visual datasets, automatically generating multiresolution hierarchies, procedural textures, and rendering with points, images, meshes, and volumes. He is currently exploring several applications in general-purpose high performance parallel computing using clusters of CPUs and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). He has consulted and collaborated with NVIDIA, Honda, IBM, Daimler Chrysler, General Dynamics, and Reuters.; As part of the UMD-University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) strategic partnership, Varshney helped bring together scientists and clinicians from both institutions to establish a multi-disciplinary Center for Health-related Bioinformatics and Bio-Imaging (CHIB), tasked with solving grand challenges in personalized medicine and health care.; Varshney received a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award, given to outstanding junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars so they can further their research in their areas of expertise, in 1995 and the IEEE Visualization Technical Achievement Award in 2004.; He was elected as a fellow of the IEEE in 2010 and is a recipient of the IEEE Technical Achievement Award. He is the director of the NVIDIA CUDA Center of Excellence at UMD and serves as a Director of the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee.; Varshney received a B. Tech. in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1989 and an M.S. and doctorate in computer science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1991 and 1994.",https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/varshney,,,

Between 1981-87 he directed several research and development projects at IDF and Shalev Computers in Israel. He was a Visiting Professor at the Technion (Israel), and the University of Caen (France).","Professor Zilberstein's research in artificial intelligence is focused on the computational foundations of automated reasoning and action. He studies the implications of uncertainty and limited computational resources on the design of autonomous agents. In most practical settings, it is not feasible to find optimal plans or actions, making it necessarily to resort to some form of approximate reasoning. This raises a simple fundamental question: what does it mean for an agent to be ""rational"" when it does not have enough knowledge or computational power to derive the best course of action? Professor Zilberstein's approach to this problem is based on probabilistic reasoning and decision-theoretic principles, used both to develop planning algorithms and to monitor their execution and maximize the value of computation. He has developed meta-level control mechanisms that reason explicitly about the cost of decision-making and can optimize the amount of deliberation (or ""thinking"") an agent does before taking action. This research spans both theoretical issues and the development of effective algorithms and applications. Zilberstein's most recent work has produced new models and algorithms to tackle these challenges in situations involving multiple decision makers operating in either collaborative or adversarial domains.",Position:; Associate Dean of Research and Engagement & Professor,https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/zilberstein_shlomo,,,,,,

Previously, he was an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University from 1997-2001. From 1993-1997, he was an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Florida, Tampa. He worked at the IBM T.J. Watson Laboratories in Hawthorne, NY from 1990-1993. From 1986-89, he was a visiting scholar in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.","Professor Mahadevan's research interests span several subfields of artificial intelligence and computer science, including machine learning, multi-agent systems, planning, perception, and robotics. His research in machine learning has been eclectic, ranging from pioneering work in explanation-based learning where his thesis introduced the model of learning apprentices for knowledge acquisition from experts, to the first rigorous study of concept learning with prior determination knowledge using the framework of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning. Over the past decade, his research has centered around a general framework for autonomous learning and sequential decision-making, which studies how agents embedded in real-world environments can acquire knowledge on how to act from a stream of noisy percepts. The framework is rigorously validated using temporal statistical process models, principally Markov decision processes. His recent research has focused on hierarchical probabilistic models, including hierarchical hidden Markov processes, semi-Markov decision processes, and hierarchical partially observable Markov decision processes. Professor Mahadevan has also developed state-of-the-art applications, including mobile robot navigation in indoor office environments, an active vision system for finding objects in cluttered rooms, and coordination among teams of factory agents optimizing production control.",Position:; Adjunct Professor,https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/mahadevan_sridhar,,,,,,

 His research involves (1) low-level sensor development to capture observable low-level physical signals from our bodies and surrounding environments with high fidelity, (2) signal interpretation algorithm development to map these low-level physical signals to relevant biological and behavioral measurements, and (3) mobile computing to run these algorithms in low power and resource settings. His research is interdisciplinary and employs core concepts and theories from different domains including applied physics, embedded and mobile computing, signal processing, machine learning, health sciences and medicine.
